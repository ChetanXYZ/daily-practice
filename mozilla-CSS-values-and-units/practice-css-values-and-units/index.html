            Summer is a time for adventure, and this year was no exception. I had many
            exciting experiences, but two of my favorites were my trip to the beach and my
            week at summer camp.

            At the beach, I spent my days swimming, collecting shells, and building
            sandcastles. I also went on a boat ride and saw dolphins swimming alongside
            us.
